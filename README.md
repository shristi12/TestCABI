# Introduction 
This is a simple practical test for an SDET role at CABI.

# Getting Started
The entire interview process is as follows
1.	Telephone interview (one-to-one)
2.	Practical test (a series of tasks for the candidate to perform to check skills and understand)
3.	Face-to-face interview (conducted with future line manager and one or two other managers)

# Practical test
The practical test is a .NET Core 3.1 soliution features a simple webapp, xUnit Tests project (for traditional unit tests) and an xUnit Specs for project for BDD-style tests using SpecFlow.

Note: This test is not necessarily an example of best practice in all cases, sometimes deliberately so, but rather is for the purposes of testing your knowledge and understanding and providing suitable discussions points in a face-to-face interview.
